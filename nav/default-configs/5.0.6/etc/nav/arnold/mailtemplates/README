In this directory we have the mail-templates. The templates are used
when Arnold sends out mails to the people responsible for a computer.

You specify the name of the template Arnold uses on the website.

A template is easy to make. It consist of a subject and whatever text
you want to include. There are some variales available for you to make
the template more informative:

$reason - the reason for this block
$list - the list of ip-addresses blocked
$comment - the comment entered when running the script

A mailtemplate may look like this (the START and EOF are for your
readability only):


START
Computers blocked because of $reason.

Some informative text.

The following computers have been blocked:

$list


Contact-information.
EOF
