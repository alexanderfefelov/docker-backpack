In this directory we have templates for time period layouts. These templates
may be used when making new profiles and are intended to make the operation of
making profiles easier.

The templates follow python config file rules, ie. first a "[section]" header
and then "name: value" pairs.

Alert profiles will only recognize the following sections:
 - [main]
 - [all_week]
 - [weekdays]
 - [weekends]

Under [main] only one entry is recognized: "description:". It's only purpose is
to describe what's special about this time period template, and is used in the
drop-down list the user can choose a template from when making a new profile.

[all_week], [weekdays] and [weekends] are used to specify the time periods, in
the same manner one would specify them in the web GUI. The "key: value" pairs
one will use here is "unique_name: start_of_period" where start_of_period is a
time stamp, ie "08:00" or "15:00". The name of the key is not important, but
should be unique to follow configuration file rules.

Example file (START and EOF are for your readability only, and should not be in
a real template file):

START
[main]
description: This is an example time period template.

[all_week]
period_1: 08:00

[weekdays]
period_1: 16:00
period_2: 22:00
period_3: 24:00

[weekends]
period_1: 04:00
EOF
