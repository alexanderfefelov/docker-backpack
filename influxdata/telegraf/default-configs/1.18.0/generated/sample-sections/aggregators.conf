# 	## This aggregator will estimate a derivative for each field, which is
# 	## contained in both the first and last metric of the aggregation interval.
# 	## Without further configuration the derivative will be calculated with
# 	## respect to the time difference between these two measurements in seconds.
# 	## The formula applied is for every field:
# 	##
# 	##               value_last - value_first
# 	## derivative = --------------------------
# 	##              time_difference_in_seconds
# 	##
# 	## The resulting derivative will be named *fieldname_rate*. The suffix
# 	## "_rate" can be configured by the *suffix* parameter. When using a
# 	## derivation variable you can include its name for more clarity.
# 	# suffix = "_rate"
# 	##
# 	## As an abstraction the derivative can be calculated not only by the time
# 	## difference but by the difference of a field, which is contained in the
# 	## measurement. This field is assumed to be monotonously increasing. This
# 	## feature is used by specifying a *variable*.
# 	## Make sure the specified variable is not filtered and exists in the metrics
# 	## passed to this aggregator!
# 	# variable = ""
# 	##
# 	## When using a field as the derivation parameter the name of that field will
# 	## be used for the resulting derivative, e.g. *fieldname_by_parameter*.
# 	##
# 	## Note, that the calculation is based on the actual timestamp of the
# 	## measurements. When there is only one measurement during that period, the
# 	## measurement will be rolled over to the next period. The maximum number of
# 	## such roll-overs can be configured with a default of 10.

#   ##  "exact R7" -- exact computation also used by Excel or NumPy (Hyndman & Fan 1996 R7)
#   ##  "exact R8" -- exact computation (Hyndman & Fan 1996 R8)
